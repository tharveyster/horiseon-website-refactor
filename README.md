# Horiseon Website Refactor

## Description

In this project, I refactored the code of the Horiseon website.

I replaced multiple ```<div>``` tags with semantic HTML elements such as ```<header>```, ```<nav>```, ```<section>```, ```<aside>```, and ```<footer>``` to ensure proper flow. The changes I made will make the site more accessible.

I also made corresponding changes to the ```style.css``` file to keep the same page design, and consolidated several of the elements where there was repetition, but kept the individual ids and classes to allow for those elements to be redesigned in the future.

The page was given a descriptive ```<title>```, and the images were provided appropriate ```alt``` attributes.
